    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the Orienteering Symbols mobile application (the "App") available on the Apple App Store. We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how we handle your data.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not collect, store, or share any personal data from its users. We do not collect any information that could identify you, such as your name, email address, or any other personal details.
    </p>    
    
    <h2>Backend and Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The App operates entirely on your device and does not have any backend server or cloud service. All functionalities of the App are available without the need for an internet connection, and no data is transmitted to or from any external servers.
    </p>    
    
    <h2>Offline Functionality</h2>
    <p>
        The App is fully functional offline and does not require an internet connection for its primary features. This means that no data is sent to, or received from, the internet during your use of the App.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Since the App does not collect or transmit any data, no third-party services are integrated that could collect or process your personal information.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>    
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes. The updated policy will be effective immediately upon posting on this page.
